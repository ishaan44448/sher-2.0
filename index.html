<LI> In the heart of the jungle, the sher roars with unmatched power. Known for its strength and 
<LI> bravery, the sher rules over all creatures with majestic pride. It walks with confidence and
<LI> hunts with precision. One day, a fearless explorer named Vaibhav entered the jungle. As he
<LI> stood face-to-face with the sher, even the trees seemed to hold their breath. But instead of
<LI> attacking, the sher bowed—recognizing Vaibhav’s courage. Since then, the jungle whispers tales
<LI> of the sher and the brave Vaibhav who earned its respect. A bond of legends was formed that day. </UL>
