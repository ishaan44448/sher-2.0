In the heart of the jungle, the sher roars with unmatched power. Known for its strength and 
bravery, the sher rules over all creatures with majestic pride. It walks with confidence and
hunts with precision. One day, a fearless explorer named Vaibhav entered the jungle. As he
stood face-to-face with the sher, even the trees seemed to hold their breath. But instead of
attacking, the sher bowed—recognizing Vaibhav’s courage. Since then, the jungle whispers tales
of the sher and the brave Vaibhav who earned its respect. A bond of legends was formed that day. </P>
